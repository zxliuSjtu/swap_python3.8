""" Script to create checkpoint after booting and exit. The cores run in
    KVM mode and exits when encounters a checkpoint.
    To properly take the checkpoint and be able to boot again and run a new
    script make sure to use the rcs/boot_checkpoint.rcS.
    The default option values should accomplish this and save the checkpoint
